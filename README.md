# Dadda-algorithm-based-8-x-8-multiplier
The Dadda algorithm is a fast multiplication technique used in digital hardware, especially in high-speed arithmetic circuits. It reduces the number of partial products efficiently and arranges them in a tree structure to minimize the required number of addition stages. It’s similar to the Wallace tree, but Dadda's method is more optimized and uses fewer hardware resources, making it power- and area-efficient.

( This project contains the files created during the process of making a semi-custom design of 8 bit dadda algorithm using cadence tools. )
